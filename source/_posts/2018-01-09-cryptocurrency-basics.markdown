Assuming we start from a base knowledge of nothing when it comes to cryptocurrency, where do we begin. Why, at the beginning, of course.

##What is cryptocurrency?

While I'll try to leave the excruciatingly painful details to the answer of this question to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), I'll try to give the shortest version that I know of, and hopefully it will be easy to understand.

So, **cryptocurrency** is simply the blending of two ideas: cryptography and currency. Let's start with the currency part.

I think everyone has a pretty decent grasp on what currency is: a medium of exchange used to obtain goods or services. Nowadays currency is usually something that people don't want in and of itself, rather it's something they want so they can get the things they _really want_ later. When people think of currency (in the US) they usually think of these guys:

Currency can be pretty much anything as long as all the parties involved agree that what they are exchanging has some value. That value can be intrinsic (like gold or silver coins), or it can just be the value that people have placed in the currency knowing that sometime in the future the currency can be traded for something with intrinsic value. When all is said and done it doesn't really matter _what_ people use as a currency. People have used copper, silver, and gold for millenia, but other examples include seemingly worthless things like seashells or beads. The list of what people have used historically as currency is far too long for this post.

So now that we know currency is just something we exchange to get something else, how does something intangible (digital) work as a currency? Pretty well, apparently. Dark web sites rely heavily on cryptocurrencies to provide (illicit) goods and services to customers. [Craigslist](https://blockexplorer.com/news/craigslist-now-allows-specify-accept-cryptocurrency-payment/) started allowing users to specify whether they will accept cryptocurrency as payment in late 2017. Many businesses now accept Bitcoin as payment, including [Newegg, Expedia, Subway, and many, many more](https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/). Enough people now consider cryptocurrency a viable means of exchanging goods and services, and so... now it is.
